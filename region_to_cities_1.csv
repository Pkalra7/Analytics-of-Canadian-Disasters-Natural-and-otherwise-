The storm made landfall at 10:30 ADT with some parts of Nova Scotia receiving up to 75 mm of rain. The high winds produced by the storm created peak waves of 23 metres in height and uprooted trees that downed power lines leaving 200,000 Nova Scotia power customers (approximately 600,000 individuals) without power. There were also extensive damages to the Halifax harbour and roads throughout Newfoundland and Nova Scotia from uprooted trees and debris. An individual drowned west of Halifax while trying to rescue a boat that broke free from its mooring.

Disaster,Natural,Meteorological - Hydrological,Winter Storm,Charlottetown PE,12/13/2008 0:00,"Prince Edward Island, December 13, 2008. An ice storm on December 13, downed 300 utility poles resulting in one of the worst power outages since the mid-1970 and cost Maritime Electric approximately $1.5 million to repair. Nearly 95 per cent of Islanders were without electricity, as freezing rain and an ice pellet-drizzle mix left thick layers of ice on roof tops, trees and transmission lines. Power poles were pulled down by ice-laden lines and strong winds. Across the province, makeshift shelters were organized in legion halls, fire stations, schools and community centres. Rescue teams and hydro crews arrived from outside the province to assist. The Canadian military also remained on standby at the Canadian Forces Base in Gagetown, NB.",,,,0,0,12/13/2008 0:00,,,,,,,,127283,

Disaster,Natural,Meteorological - Hydrological,Flood,Lethbridge AB,6/19/2013 0:00,"Southern Alberta, June 19-28, 2013. A massive storm system crept through Alberta causing significant flooding throughout the province. As of 2013, this event was responsible for the largest evacuation due to a natural disaster in Albertaís history. Beginning in northern Alberta, Fort McMurray declared a local state of emergency when water from the Hanging Stone River breached its banks on June 8. The storm then moved south on June 19, where it remained for three days over southern Alberta. Heavy rain spanning across a region from Canmore to Calgary produced an average of 75 to 150 mm during this three-day period. Twenty-nine local states of emergency were declared throughout the province. Four deaths were attributed to the floods, which caused significant disruptions across the province to power, telecommunications, clean water supply, and transportation corridors, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway that closed due to a mudslide caused by the torrential rain. In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion. This disaster is estimated to have reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Southern Alberta by $550 million (2013 dollars).",4,0,100000,2715742000,132690977.2,6/28/2013 0:00,1015742000,,,,,1700000000,,,

The season began early with the discovery of the Little Bobtail Lake fire on May 9. Many fires were within a close proximity of urban areas prompting evacuation orders and alerts across the province. A number of communities were affected by evacuation orders and alerts. Evacuation orders were issued for 141 homes in Joe Rich Kelowna, 70 homes in West Kelowna, 150 homes in Port Hardy and 110 homes in Testalinden, including others. In Puntzi Lake, 90 homes were evacuated and 18 structures were destroyed, while in Rock Creek 330 homes were evacuated and 30 homes as well as 15 other structures were destroyed.

The USDA then contacted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) whom initiated an investigation into the outbreak. The investigation found that one herd of cattle in Alberta was infected with TB. The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
